Progress 5/6/25
 	  I’ve completed the final version of my command-line calculator project. I modularized the program by separating the unary and binary operations into their own functions. 
  This not only made the code cleaner but also easier to expand or debug. I also improved input parsing by fully switching to fgets and sscanf, which gave me better control over user input and fixed cases where 
  letters or malformed expressions were misinterpreted.	In addition to that, I added final quality improvements: the calculator now loops automatically so the user can perform multiple calculations without 
  restarting the program, input is validated more clearly, and the output is formatted to display results cleanly. These changes helped finalize the project’s structure and improved its overall reliability and 
  user experience.												
    The last hurdle I faced was with GitHub. I originally tried to push updates to the same repository I had created earlier in the semester, but I kept running into push errors.
  After trying to troubleshoot without success, I decided to create a brand-new GitHub repository and move the entire project there. Once that was done, everything worked smoothly, 
  and I was able to successfully upload both the code and report.
